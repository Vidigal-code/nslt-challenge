# Front-End Documentation - React + Material UI + Storybook

## Scripts in `package.json`

The scripts defined in `package.json` are commands that you can run using a Node.js package manager (like `npm` or `yarn`). They are used to automate tasks such as starting the development server, building the application, or generating component documentation in Storybook. Below is the explanation of the defined scripts:

### 1. `dev`
- **Command:** `"vite"`
- **Description:** This command starts the development server using Vite, a modern and fast build tool for frontend projects. The server will run in development mode, and the application will automatically reload whenever there are changes to the files.

### 2. `build`
- **Command:** `"vite build"`
- **Description:** This command runs the Vite build process, which compiles and optimizes the project for production. It will bundle the files and generate the output in a `dist/` folder, ready for deployment.

### 3. `serve`
- **Command:** `"vite preview"`
- **Description:** This command previews the built application. After running the `build` script, you can use this command to preview the production build locally to make sure everything works as expected before deploying.

### 4. `storybook`
- **Command:** `"storybook dev -p 6006"`
- **Description:** This command starts the Storybook development server on port 6006. Storybook is a tool for developing and showcasing UI components in isolation. It helps you build and test components in a separate environment, independent of the main application.

### 5. `build-storybook`
- **Command:** `"storybook build"`
- **Description:** This command builds the Storybook static site, compiling all the UI components and documentation into a static output that can be deployed or served. It generates a `storybook-static/` folder containing the production-ready build of the Storybook site.
